<!-- date tree for browsing. this works by covertly reloading the current page each time, but modifying the URL params so that it changes slightly each time. we start out with just a list of decades from the api. clicking on a decade will tell the site to reload with that decade's years unfolded. same thing for issues: click an issue and it reloads with the new information for issues. currently only able to keep one nesting open at a time, because it resets the params with each click. -->
